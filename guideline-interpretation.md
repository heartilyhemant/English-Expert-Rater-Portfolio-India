# Interpretation of Rating Guidelines for Indian English
For Welocalize’s Expert Rater role, I apply global quality rating principles *with nuance for Indian English users*—here’s my core approach:

### 1. Relevance
- Prioritize **local Indian intent** (e.g., a query like “best mutual funds in India” requires results specific to SEBI-regulated funds, not global options).
- Account for Indian English colloquialisms (e.g., “chai stall” vs. “tea shop” – both are valid, but context must align with Indian usage).

### 2. Authoritativeness
- For Indian topics (e.g., Aadhar, UPI, Indian education), prioritize government/official Indian sources (e.g., uidai.gov.in, cbse.nic.in) over international sites.

### 3. Linguistic Quality
- Accept Indian English spellings/terms (e.g., “colour”, “flat”, “lift”) as standard for the Indian market.
- Flag AI-generated text that uses non-Indian English (e.g., “elevator” instead of “lift” in a local Indian context) for contextual misalignment.

### 4. User Experience
- Evaluate mobile-friendliness critically (80% of Indian internet users access content via mobile, per TRAI 2025 data).
