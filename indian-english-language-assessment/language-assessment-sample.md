### Assessment Results
| Criterion | Rating | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Indian English Terminology | **Needs Revision** | "Elevator" is not standard Indian English (use "lift"); "chai shop" is correct, but "mall" is acceptable for urban Indian context. |
| Grammatical Accuracy | **Pass** | Sentence structure is correct. |
| Cultural Context | **Pass** | "Chai shop in Bangalore" aligns with Indian urban culture. |
| Suggestion for Improvement | Change "elevator" to "lift" to match Indian English usage: *"Take the lift to the 3rd floor of the mall to find a chai shop in Bangalore."* |
